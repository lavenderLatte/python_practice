    "Alice likes playing a word game. If you give her a word, she will give a suggestion that she thinks it's closest to the word from the vocabulary she knows. Her vocabulary is limited to words from story of \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\". \n",

    "When she knows the word you gave her, she will give the same word as suggestion. On the other hand, if she doesn't know, she will find the \"cloesest word\" based on the following..\n",

    "            Let's say you gave her a word \"cha\" for a word suggestion. \n",

    "              \n",
    "            If we compare \"cha\" to \"act\", two letters in cha exist in act: 'c' and 'a'.\n",

    "\n",
    "   - Note that we are checking whether each letters in your word can be found in Alice's vocab. This reduce the chance of the getting not-so-ideal suggestion from Alice. If we were counting the number of matching letter in Alice's word to your word, the number of matching letters of \"hhhh\" is 4 instead of 1.\n",

    "The last two from Alice's approach of finding the closest word, would they found you the best/ultimate suggestion? How could we define the \"ultimate\" suggestion? What would you like to get as a suggested word between \"that\" or \"the\" when you give her \"tha\". Alice will give you \"that\" since there are 3 matching letters. However, \"the\" has a higher probability since we use it more often than \"that\" in sentences. On the other hand, it's possible that user prematually pressed the enter before finishing typing each letters of \"that\". How should we decide the precedence of these two steps......\n",
