    "If Alice were giving precedence to most occuring word to be the closest-word, \"be\" will get picked although there are other two words that has more matching letters which seems better suggestion. In fact, \"be\" is second most frequently appearing word in written english according to an analysis of the Oxford English Corpus(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_common_words_in_English). Therefore, Alice will give us \"the\", \"be\", \"to\", etc. as a word suggestion for any given words look similar to them. This will limit her word suggestion pool to those most occuring ones in written english as long as it's in her vocabulary. \n",
